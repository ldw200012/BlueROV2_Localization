# I. How to install ROS Noetic
You can take a look at below ROS Wiki page to follow instructions to ROS Noetic installation

http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu

# II. How to create ROS Package
1. Get into your ROS workspace

       $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
  
   - in case you have another name for your ROS workspace

         $ cd ~/<workspace_name>/src

2. Copy a ROS Package

       $ git clone https://github.com/ldw200012/bluerov_kalmanfilter.git


3. Run below commands to configure your ROS Package

       $ cd ~/catkin_ws
       $ catkin_make
       $ source devel/setup.bash
  
   - in case you have another name for your ROS workspace

         $ cd ~/<workspace_name>
         $ catkin_make
         $ source devel/setup.bash

# III. How to use Kalman Filter in Python
First, you have to grab the idea what Kalman Filter is.

You can check the basic understandings of Kalman Filter in the following website

https://www.kalmanfilter.net/alphabeta.html



After you understand what Kalman Filter is, you can now implement Python code using Kalman Filter in FilterPy library.

You can check the existing Python library for Kalman Filter in the following website

https://filterpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kalman/KalmanFilter.html
